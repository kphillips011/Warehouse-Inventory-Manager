Project Abstract (summary): 
This program is a warehouse inventory manager that incorporates file I/O and allows the user to manipulate the inventory in various ways. For example, by sorting the inventory items by various elements (such as date of arrival or price), adding or removing elements to/from the inventory, reading items from an input file, or printing data out to an invoice or log. The user will also be able to determine the total value of their inventory and be alerted if a certain item’s quantity is too low and products need to be ordered. We will also include elements that can be used by a hypothetical Point of Sale or other similar program to externally manipulate the inventory. 

Workflow: Weekly meetings through zoom on Thursdays at 3pm, communication through slack private message group, communicating push and pull from Github, defined weekly milestones, etc

Project Design:
* Language: Java
* Useful data structures: Maps, Lists, Arrays, File I/O, FIFO Queue, Sorting, and possibly Recursion
* Warehouse logs where data is printed out to
* Inventory items being listed and sorted by item’s ID, price, quantity, alphabetical ordering, etc
* Reading an input file of items and then adding them to the inventory
* Adding/removing items from the inventory using methods
* Searching through the inventory
* Alerting the user if a certain item’s quantity is too low, possibly using recursion
* Documentation for the program’s users
* Flexibility of use for hypothetical businesses/warehouses
* Efficient space and time complexity

Related Projects (at least 2):
* Use of LIFO vs FIFO (our project) or ones that use a hybrid approach. 
* Cloud-based approach vs on premise or ones that use a combination of both like the free, commercial product from Square

How to run the program:  
* Use inventoryIn.txt to add products into the inventory to be read by the reader (with format ID# Name Price Quantity).
* The program prints out log.md files with tables of all the items in the inventory sorted by ID, price, quantity, and alphabetical ordering
