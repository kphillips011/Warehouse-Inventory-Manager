# Warehouse-Inventory-Manager

Project Abstract (summary):

This program is a warehouse inventory manager that incorporates file I/O and allows the user to manipulate the inventory in various ways. For example, by sorting the inventory items by various elements (such as date of arrival or price), adding or removing elements to/from the inventory, reading items from an input file, or printing data out to an invoice or log. The user will also be able to determine the total value of their inventory and be alerted if a certain itemâ€™s quantity is too low and products need to be ordered. We will also include elements that can be used by a hypothetical Point of Sale or other similar program to externally manipulate the inventory.
