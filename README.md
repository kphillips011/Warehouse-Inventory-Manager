Project Abstract (summary): 
This program is a warehouse inventory manager that incorporates file I/O and allows the user to manipulate the inventory in various ways. For example, by sorting the inventory items by various elements (such as date of arrival or price), adding or removing elements to/from the inventory, reading items from an input file, or printing data out to an invoice or log. The user will also be able to determine the total value of their inventory and be alerted if a certain item’s quantity is too low and products need to be ordered. We will also include elements that can be used by a hypothetical Point of Sale or other similar program to externally manipulate the inventory. 

Roles: 
Lead Programmer - Kendall
The ‘leader’ of the group and does the bulk of the functional class programming (however, everyone will be involved in programming). The person who owns the GitHub repository.
Quality/Testing Manager - Eric 
Responsible for writing/managing test classes and making sure the code is organized in an efficient and attractive manner, i.e. final-correctness rule is followed. Keeps track of any problems that arise with the code.
Progress Manager - Justin 
Makes sure that the group is meeting the project requirements. Researches related projects and figures, and sets the group milestones. Writes up any documents. Helps with coding.

Workflow: Weekly meetings through zoom on Thursdays at 3pm, communication through slack private message group, communicating push and pull from Github, defined weekly milestones, etc
Github Repository: https://github.com/kphillips011/Warehouse-Inventory-Manager.git

Project Design:
Language: Java
Useful data structures: Maps, Lists, Arrays, File I/O, FIFO Queue, Sorting, and possibly Recursion
Warehouse log where data is printed out to (total warehouse value, product ID, what has gone in and out of the warehouse that day, net profit/loss)
Inventory items being listed and sorted by date they came in, name, item’s ID, price, quantity, alphabetical ordering, etc
Reading an input file of items and then adding them to the inventory
Adding/removing items from the inventory using methods
Searching through the inventory
Alerting the user if a certain item’s quantity is too low, possibly using recursion
Documentation for the program’s users
Flexibility of use for hypothetical businesses/warehouses
Efficient space and time complexity


Milestones (weekly, every Saturday):
April 4 - Create the “skeletons” of all classes: Main, file management classes, inventory access/management classes, and test classes. Most if not all methods should be there but the program shouldn’t really run as intended yet.
April 11 - At least two classes, including Main, should be passing tests and running. The inventory data structure should be able to be accessed, modified, and sorted in various ways, given a test example.
April 18 - File management is implemented, including reading elements from a file and adding them to the inventory, and printing data from the inventory out to a “log”. The program should be working as intended now.
April 25 - Final submission due! Documentation is added, code is organized and refined, and extra features (such as quantity alerts) are added.


Related Projects (at least 2):
Use of LIFO vs FIFO (our project) or ones that use a hybrid approach. 
Cloud-based approach vs on premise or ones that use a combination of both like the free, commercial product from Square
